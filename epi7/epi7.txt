From Bronze to GM in miniKanren!

Episode 7 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEhcC-zvJ68)

mental fortitude and cons pairs

(Oh yeah, it's 2025, not 2024!  I was a bit out of it...)

I read the news a little too much today...

laddered tonight

ViBE: micro vs. macro

"undergrad" thinking vs. "grad school" thinking

research practices, and research thinking, from the beginning

mental/emotional resiliance

Richard Fortey (in `Trilobite!: Eyewitness to Evolution`, if I recall correctly) -- researcher who studied a specific subspecies of insect for 40+ years

G.R.R.M. story about book signing

little bits of encouragement can go a long way

Clojure community and miniKanren

first thing to add to our ladder practice for today

community and mentoring


core Scheme:
quote, symbols, pairs, lists


Previous ladder practice: 

* learn your powers of 2 up to some credible number (at least to 2^10), and keep in mind that:

** 2^10 is approximately 10^3
** 2^20 is approximately 10^6
** 2^30 is approximately 10^9

* read up on signed and unsigned two's complement integer representations, if you are not familiar already (32-bit signed two's complement integer, for example)

* read about the Ariane 5 rocket mishap due to overflow, and also the Patriot missile battery overflow errors

* think about the differences in the design on Scheme and Java when it comes to integers, overflow, etc.



Ladder practice:

* let someone whose work you admire or has inspired you know -- please give specifics

* practice consing up list and pair structures, drawing box-and-pointer diagrams, predicting where the REPL will print dots for improper lists, etc.

* read up on lists, pairs, and proper/improper lists in TSPL4

* read at least one Scheme paper
