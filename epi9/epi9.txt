Previous ladder practice:

* micro: practice consing up various tree patterns, using car and cdr to access values in the consed up tree, drawing box and pointer diagrams, and predicting what the printed representation of a cons expression will look like

* macro: write down ideas and observations and what you are reading and what you want to read and questions and potential research projects in your research notebook

basic scheme editing commands

((((a c b) (1 2 3))))

(let ((x (+ 3 4))
      (y (* 3 4)))
  (let ((x (+ x x)))
    (cond
      ((zero? x)
       0)
      (else
       (* x x)))))

;; MIT/SICP syntax
(define (add n m)
  (+ n m))

;; IU/Dan syntax
(define add
  (lambda (n m)
    (+ n m)))

(add 3 4)

* micro:
read the TSPL4 sections on:
