Getting unstuck; taking responsibility and initiative for our own learning

Slogans/quotes/sayings (I tried to correct/attribute the quotes after I recorded the video):

"We're not making hambugers here." (I recall reading this quote in a Tom DeMarco book many years ago)

"Now I need to discuss science versus engineering. Science, if you are doing it, you shouldn’t know what you’re doing. If you know what you’re doing, you shouldn’t be doing it. Not in science, because science is supposed to be exploration. But you don’t know. Engineering. You shouldn’t be doing it unless you do know what you’re doing. Well, nothing is pure. Science involves a great deal of engineering. And engineering involves a great deal of new material. So it’s a great blend. But what is painful to you is going to be worse, is that they two fields are growing together because of a simple fact. Again, going back by first candy Bell Labs, when suddenly we discovered in physics. The telephone company was not in that greater hurry to get it developed it into the field, after all have pretty much monopoly, why hurry? Now as you know, we are not willing to wait for scientific principles to develop we want the field tomorrow. So two fields to come together like that." Richard Hamming in his lecture ``Learning to Learn'' given at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, March 28, 1995 (https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/learning-to-learn-by-richard-hamming)

"The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think you know what you’re doing." Richard Hamming (which I attributed to Bret Victor, who is fond of this saying)

"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ``Eureka!'' (I found it!) but ``That’s funny...''" attributed to Isaac Asimov by the UNIX `fortune` program, according to https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/03/02/eureka-funny/
