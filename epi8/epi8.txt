From Bronze to GM in miniKanren!

Episode 8

feeling better today

less news and more ViBE and ArtosisCasts and laddering

cheesed out a bit, but that doesn't matter -- spreading creep, injects, drone saturation, avoiding supply blocks

Day[9] -- "... the problem is in your base, not your opponent's base"

ups and down come with the territory

got a nice thank you letter in the mail

a couple of fun comments

Velvet Underground and Brian Eno

Mike Portnoy hears Taylor Swift -- Drumeo

Neal Stephenson story -- "she hadn't heard of me because I was famous"

Python and Java for me



Previous ladder practice:

* let someone whose work you admire or has inspired you know -- please give specifics

* practice consing up list and pair structures, drawing box-and-pointer diagrams, predicting where the REPL will print dots for improper lists, etc.

* read up on lists, pairs, and proper/improper lists in TSPL4

* read at least one Scheme paper



Micro

cons, pairs, proper lists, quote, symbols, empty list, car, cdr, null?, box and pointer diagram


Macro

reading
research notebook
let's look at a new ArXiV preprint



Ladder practice:

* micro: practice consing up various tree patterns, using car and cdr to access values in the consed up tree, drawing box and pointer diagrams, and predicting what the printed representation of a cons expression will look like

* write down ideas and observations and what you are reading and what you want to read and questions and potential research projects in your research notebook
