From Bronze to GM in miniKanren!

Why?:
* share what I have learned (and share what I would like to figure out)
* people have asked me to make more videos on programming and programming languages and research and all that
* an audience similar to that for `The Theoretical Minimum` exists for academic PL, Scheme, miniKanren, etc.
* fun

Inspirations/influences:
* apprenticeship in PL
* Bronze to GM series on YouTube (dApollo, filtersc, Vibe, etc.)
* `The Theoretical Minimum` series of books, videos, courses
* ``hangout movies''/comfort food movies/``healing'' VTubers

What are we going to cover?

** how I think about these things, skills and techniques I've aquired,
   point of view, taste, etc., and what I think is important/critical
   to know/be able to do **

* Scheme
** where Scheme is strong, and why people who learn Scheme in undergrad often don't get the point
** evaluation of Scheme
** interpreters and environments and all that
** metaprogramming
** macros
** DSL design and implementation
* miniKanren
** the base language
** extended language with constraints
** simple example programs
** evaluation rules and semantics
** relational interpreters, parsers, type inferences
** different versions of miniKanren
** various constraint systems and extensions
** implementation
* how *I* think about Scheme and miniKanren
* resources for Scheme and miniKanren
* excersizes for Scheme and miniKanren
* research
** reading research papers
** implementing research papers
** assessing research papers
** exploring and implementing and assessing ideas
** communicating the results
** thinking about limitations, challenges, and opportunities for relational programming
** trying to make progress to drive relational programming further
