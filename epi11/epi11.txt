Miloš Forman advice to Edward Norton



Previous ladder practice:

* micro:

go through the quote and quasiquote sections in TSPL4:
https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/objects.html#./objects:s5

and read the sections on quote and quasiquote in R6RS:
https://www.r6rs.org/

and try out the examples in Chez Scheme

optional: try out the examples in Racket--how does the behavior differ, if at all?

read Quasiquotation in Lisp -- Alan Bawden
https://oneofus.la/have-emacs-will-hack/files/bawden.pdf

* macro:

read or watch one or more of the above books or talks about the creative life and making things, or do so for some other resource


Ladder practice:

* micro:

The end of 4.2.6 of R5RS contains the sentence: "Unpredictable behavior can result if any of the symbols 'quasiquote', 'unquote', or 'unquote-splicing' appear in positions within a 〈qq template〉 otherwise than as described above."

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out *why* this wording doesn't seem to appear in the R6RS or the R7RS Small.  Do these newer reports contain similar warnings?  If so, how has the language changed?  If there is no warning, is this because the unpredictable behavior must now be checked by the implementation?  If so, how is a violation handled?  Try to figure out what is going on!

* macro:

Read one of the classic 'Lambda the Ultimate' Scheme papers from Sussman and Steele.
