More crack climbing analogy

"Hey, Will!  I want to go climbing with you!"

"Hey, Will!  I want to do research with you!"



"Here is a paper describing my new programming language!  What do you think?"

Oops, you accidentally a ...

Oops, you accidentally a well-known feature from 40 years ago.

Oops, you accidentally a well-known broken feature from 40 years ago.

Oops, you accidentally a Turing-complete configuration language.

Oops, you accidentally a language with dynamic scope.

Oops, you accidentally an unsound typesystem.

Oops, you accidentally a typesystem with undecidable type inference.

Oops, you accidentally a bunch of core language features that don't compose.

Oops, you accidentally a constraint with doubly-exponential time complexity.

Oops, you accidentally a macro system with hygiene problems.

Oops, you accidentally an implementation technique that requires copying the entire heap after every operation.

Scheme and Java

computer organization

comparison, tradeoffs, design decisions, etc.

Ladder practice:

* learn your powers of 2 up to some credible number (at least to 2^10), and keep in mind that:

** 2^10 is approximately 10^3
** 2^20 is approximately 10^6
** 2^30 is approximately 10^9

* read up on signed and unsigned two's complement integer representations, if you are not familiar already (32-bit signed two's complement integer, for example)

* read about the Ariane 5 rocket mishap due to overflow, and also the Patriot missile battery overflow errors

* think about the differences in the design on Scheme and Java when it comes to integers, overflow, etc.
